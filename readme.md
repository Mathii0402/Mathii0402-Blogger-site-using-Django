## MY BLOGGER SITE 
    I had done this project using Django. I had created a blog site where only the admin can add, delete, modify the content, but all users have access to read it. The author may make it as a draft or publish it. The admin page is customized as it has filters, list view and a search option.
    
## Main Feautures 
    - The admin can add blogs.
    - He can filter blogs based on Published or not.
    - The user can view the blogs created by the admin.
  
## The app is alive at ðŸ‘‡
